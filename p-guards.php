                                   <h2>Why Flange Guards & Spray Shields are used?</h2>
                                   <p>In any piping system, there are numerous joints & threaded fittings in forms of flanges, unions, T & elbows, sockets or expansion joints. Other than that, there is a lot of equipment like heat exchanger or pressurized valves installed to control the flow of service liquids. These joints are subject to heavy stress associated with mechanical vibration and wear due to the pressure to which they are exposed. This leads to joints failure & the toxic liquid is sprayed on unsuspecting workers & expensive equipment in form of a violent splash of toxic chemicals.  This has caused millions of critical injuries resulting in thousands of deaths. Flange Safety Spray Shields are used to protect from these catastrophic incidents. Various Government regulations & Insurance Requirements make it compulsory for industries to use flange guards.</p>

                                          Flange guard commonly known as a Flange spray shield is a safety device designed to contain hazardous spray outs, oil mists & acid splashes. Flange Spray Guards & Safety Shields are installed on Flanges, Pipe Joints & valves. In an event of splash or a spray out, these flange guards completely absorbs the kinetic energy of the splash and renders it completely harmless. This simple hardware has saved countless of lives in the recent time. Flange Guards are available in various material. The choice of material for a safety spray shield or Flange Guard depends on the temperature, pressure & corrosive strength of the service fluid.

These are small but important parts of a piping system without which a piping system cannot function. Like most of the joints, these joints are also subject to leaks. A number of times these fittings are installed above man height and thus making them dangerous in the  event of a leak. These pipe spray shields are essential to ensure pipeline safety. </p>

flow of the fluid. Valves alone account for almost 10 percent of the cost of total piping system. In ancient times
tree branches were used to regulate water. The Roman Empire was unmatchable in early days in controlling
and storage of fresh waters. In fact, the castellum was the first water Sewerage system in the historic city of
Pompeii. The distribution and regulation of water from the aqueduct through 3 outlets was done by the
castellum. Egg shaped Lead Pipe was used in the transportation of water. Unfortunately, the ancient city of
Pompeii was buried under the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD.
The excavations have led to the finding of bronze valves which were used to pump water uphill to the
castellum.</p><br />

                                   <p>2. Seat or the seal of the Valve getst damaged with time.</p><br />
                                   <p>3. Maintenance failure.</p><br />
                                   <p>These leakages have been d fined by various standards like API,ANSI,MSS,FCI etc.</p><br />
                                   <p>Many of the catastrophic accidents in the past have been due to Valve leakages and subsequent splash.
Industrial Valves Are regulating devices which at any given time are holding high pressure fluids. Primarily
because of two reasons valve leaks are more dangerous compared to Flange leaks:<br />
1. Imagine a close valve leaking which is holding a high-pressure fluid whereas In most cases flange are subject
to fluid movement.</p><br />
                                   <p>2. Valves have been designed to operate so the worker interference is not limited whereas flanges have limited
interference mostly during maintenance.</p><br />
                                   <p><strong>
    These reasons makes a Valve Spray out very dangerous. We have specially designed Valve Spray shields to
    contain these leaks and keep your manpower safe at all times. Installation of Valve Spray Shields and valve
    guards also increases you workers morale while handling these equipment. Valves shields come in three types
    of material commonly:
</strong></p><br />
                                   <p>1. Teflon coated fibreglass Spray shields with dual locking<br />
2. Teflon Coated Fibreglass Spray shields with visual inspection window and dual locking (Clear Type)<br />
3. Stainless steel Grade 316 shields for high temperature and highly corrosive environment.</p><br />
                                   <p>Every Valve spray shield is tested for appropriate pressure requirement at our pressure testing rig. These Valve
shields are specially stitched with Kevlar threads giving it very high strength. Cotton or nylon stitched valve
guards may come out during a leak as these threads are not designed to handle such kind of environment and
pressure. Material used in these Valve shields are flame resistant and Teflon / Kevlar braided ropes give the
valve shields its much-desired pressure holding strength. Every Indana Valve spray shield is a life saving and
equipment saving device.</p>

                                   <p>Valves are critical components of any piping system. They are used to regulate the flow of fluid as per process requirement. They are designed to handle extreme pressures. Most of the catastrophic accidents have taken place because of valve leaks. Piping <a href=" valve-spray-shield.php">valve Spray guards</a> are used to contain these dangerous spray outs. These piping valves are also subject to extreme temperatures. The Valve spray shield selection is based on the design, pressure, and temperature. For different types of valves, there are a wide variety of valve safety shields available. The most commonly shielded type of valves are ball valves followed by butterfly valves & check valves.</p>

	<h5>Design</h5>
	<P>Design Plays A Critical Part In Every Flange Guard Or Flange Spray Shield In India. Most Of The Flange Leak Guards Available In The Market Are Ornamental In Nature Without Any Real. As A Manufacturer<!--  Of SS PP PTFE Flange Guard In India, --> We Make Sure That Our Stainless Steel SS Flange Guard /Shield Has Been Designed With A Steel Mesh. <!-- That Diffuses The Pressure In Case Of A Leak. The Double Locking Feature Prevents The Flange Guard From Loosening Or Opening Up.The PTFE Flange Guard Has An Easy Leak Detection With A Three Layer Support. PP Flange Guards Have Transparency For Early Detection Of Leaks. Safety Flange Guard / Shield For Flange Should Not Be Very Tightly Applied On The Flange As This Can Lead To A Pressure Built Up. --></p>

	<h5>Maintenance </h5>
	<p>Stainless Steel SS Flange Guards / Shield, PP Flange Guards & PTFE Flange Spray Shields Are 0 Zero Maintenance Safety Guards. In Case Of Greasing The Flanges: </p><br>
	<p>1. Unlock The Pp, Ptfe Or Stainless Steel SS Flange Guard </p><br>
    <p>2. Grease The Flanges Guard</p><br>
    <!-- <p>3. Put The Lock Back On The PTFE, PP,Stainless Steel SS Flange Guards</p><br>
    <p>4. It Takes Less Than 60 Seconds To Install And Uninstall The PP, PTFE, Stainless Steel SS Flange Guard. Stainless Steel SS Flange Guards Are 100% Reusable And Can Be Used On Rectangular Flanges Also.</p> -->
