                                       Similar to the Valves of the heart, In a piping system also Valves regulates, controls, isolates and directs the
                                       flow of the fluid. Valves alone account for almost 10 percent of the cost of total piping system. In ancient times
                                       tree branches were used to regulate water. The Roman Empire was unmatchable in early days in controlling
                                       and storage of fresh waters. In fact, the castellum was the first water Sewerage system in the historic city of
                                       Pompeii. The distribution and regulation of water from the aqueduct through 3 outlets was done by the
                                       castellum. Egg shaped Lead Pipe was used in the transportation of water. Unfortunately, the ancient city of
                                       Pompeii was buried under the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD.
                                       The excavations have led to the finding of bronze valves which were used to pump water uphill to the
                                       castellum.

                                   <p>1. Cannot be closed due to foreign particles, dust and debris.</p><br />
                                   <p>2. Seat or the seal of the Valve gets damaged with time.</p><br />
                                   <p>3. Maintenance failure.</p><br />
                                   <p>These leakages have been d fined by various standards like API,ANSI,MSS,FCI etc.</p><br />

                                       Many of the catastrophic accidents in the past have been due to Valve leakages and subsequent splash.
                                       Industrial Valves Are regulating devices which at any given time are holding high pressure fluids. Primarily
                                       because of two reasons valve leaks are more dangerous compared to Flange leaks:<br />
                                       1. Imagine a close valve leaking which is holding a high-pressure fluid whereas In most cases flange are subject
                                       to fluid movement.
                                   </p><br />
                                   <p>
                                       2. Valves have been designed to operate so the worker interference is not limited whereas flanges have limited
                                       interference mostly during maintenance.
                                   </p><br />

                                           These reasons makes a Valve Spray out very dangerous. We have specially designed Valve Spray shields to

                                       Every Valve spray shield is tested for appropriate pressure requirement at our pressure testing rig. These Valve
                                       shields are specially stitched with Kevlar threads giving it very high strength. Cotton or nylon stitched valve
                                       guards may come out during a leak as these threads are not designed to handle such kind of environment and
                                       pressure. Material used in these Valve shields are flame resistant and Teflon / Kevlar braided ropes give the
                                       valve shields its much-desired pressure holding strength. Every Indana Valve spray shield is a life saving and
